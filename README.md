# gitnoob

gitnoob is just a small layer of abstraction for the most used git tasks.
It helps adopting good practices and pushing clean code, while reducting the number of commands needed to push code.
(Note : you can still use git commands directly if you want)

Using gitnoobs commands basically :

- prevents you from coding directly into dev branch
- prevents from merging breaking code into dev branch
- force you to code inside feature branches
- maintain a clean structure in dev and master

to get a list of available commands, use the -h argument.
## installation
first you have to have ruby installed.
Move the repository to a place you like, then you can run the install script (from the gitnoob folder) to add a symbolic link to the script in the `/bin` folder

```
chmod a+x install.sh
./install.sh
```

if you want helpfull short aliases to be added you can also execute the addaliases script (still from the gitnoob folder)

```
chmod a+x ./addaliases.sh
source addaliases.sh
```
### prepare your repository
(here is a list of all the steps from nothing but you should pickup from where you actually are, you might already have a compatible repository)
- build a new repository with `git init`
- add your remote with `git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git`
- create the `dev` branch with `git init` git checkout -b dev
- push all your branches with `git push --all origin`
(if you already have a compatible architecture, make sure you are on the `dev` branch before starting using gitnoob)

## Understanding gitnoob
Here is the simple concept of gitnoob workflow :
The *master* branch hold your releases, the *dev* branch always contain a potentially releasable version of your code, and you are forced to create a *feature* branch if you wanna work.

### the master branch
Each commit on this branch is considered a new viable version of your application, suitable for production testing and deployment.
That branch cannot be accessed directly, to create Ã  new version you use the `-v` argument form the dev branch.

### the dev branch
The dev branch is the base where feature branches are created. You cannot commit directly inside dev but can begin a new feature or re-open an existing one with the `-f` option.

### feature branches
Feature branches are the right place to code, **"feature-"**  automatically prepend the git name of a feature branch. From here you can :

- stage all you changes and commit them using `-c [commit message]`
- update your feature with changes that happened in the *dev* branch with `-u`
- go back to *dev* with `-r`
- finish your feature and add it to *dev* with `-p` (as in "prune"), note that your feature will not be added to dev it tests fails (rails only for now)

*Note : feature branches are automatically sync with origin (online) for collaboration purposes but you can branch locally from a feature branch if you want to, with the native git commands.*

## dicussion / improvements

- todo: ask if feature branches should be pushed on creation and deleted on the remote on deletion (if present on remote)
- todo: run system tests before creating a new version ?
- add a basic init function that create the repository, add a remote and sets up all the needed branches to start a project fast
- we might consider removing the dev branch as the code here is supposed to be ready to deploy. It looks like it could be simplified.
